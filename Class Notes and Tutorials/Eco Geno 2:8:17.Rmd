**Continuing with RNAseq analysis**

- finish cleaning (trimomatic)
- fastqc (visual)
- make table of # reads
- design assembly tests
- start assemblies
- evaluate assemblies

*In terminal, some useful commands*  

The "move" command can change the name of your file OR move it to a new directory (or both at the same time)   

```{}
mv FILENAME NEWFILENAME
```
*running fastq to look at the quality of the data*   

```{}
fastqc FILENAME.fq.gz   
```

*after that's done, move the .html file to your computer using the scp command from your machine (hint: open another terminal but DON'T sign in to the server)*   

```{}
[rtyler1@pbio381 ~]$ scp rtyler1@pbio381.uvm.edu:/data/project_data/fastq/cleanreads/19_5-11_H_0_R2_clean_paired_fastqc.html .
```

We will only use the paired reads to assemble

What would change the assembly? 
- varied parameters
